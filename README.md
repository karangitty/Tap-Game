🕹 Tap Game

Tap-Game is an interactive Flutter app where two players compete by tapping on their respective colored halves of the screen. Each tap shifts a portion of the screen from one side to the other, and the first player whose side occupies the majority wins.

🎯 What It Does

The screen is divided into two halves: black and brown.

Each player taps their half:

A tap increases their side’s area.

The other side’s area shrinks accordingly.


Scores are tracked and displayed for both players.

The game ends when one side expands past a threshold.

A Restart button resets everything to defaults and lets players start over.
